Initially portrayed as a solitary and miserly businessman, Scrooge lives alone in a dark, cold house once shared with his deceased partner, Jacob Marley. He is cautious, skeptical, and dismissive of anything beyond material reality, preferring frugality and isolation to warmth and companionship. His days are marked by routine and his nights by guarded solitude, reflecting a life consumed by greed and emotional detachment.\n\nScrooge’s transformation begins when he is visited by a succession of Spirits who guide him through visions of Christmas past, present, and future. With each encounter, he is forced to confront the consequences of his choices and the emptiness of his existence. Traveling with the Spirits, Scrooge observes scenes of joy, charity, and family life that contrast sharply with his own loneliness. He witnesses the bustling streets of Christmas morning, the humble but loving celebration of the Cratchit family, and the tender concern for Tiny Tim’s fragile health. These experiences awaken in him feelings of compassion and remorse, emotions long buried beneath his cynicism.\n\nAs his journey continues, Scrooge’s curiosity and emotional vulnerability deepen. He questions the Spirits about generosity, kindness, and the meaning of Christmas, gradually realizing the moral and spiritual poverty of his own life. His observations of the Cratchits’ warmth and the community’s goodwill stir a longing for connection and redemption. The most harrowing vision comes when he sees thieves dividing the possessions of a deceased man, only to discover that the man is himself. This grim revelation forces Scrooge to confront the legacy of his greed and the isolation that awaits him in death.\n\nGuided by the final Spirit, the Phantom, Scrooge witnesses the dark corners of the city and the suffering of those neglected by society. These scenes of poverty and despair mirror the consequences of his indifference, compelling him to change. Through fear, reflection, and newfound empathy, Scrooge undergoes a profound moral awakening.\n\nBy the end of his supernatural journey, Ebenezer Scrooge emerges transformed. No longer the cold-hearted miser, he becomes a man of generosity, warmth, and compassion. He embraces the spirit of Christmas, extending kindness to those around him and becoming a father figure to Tiny Tim. His life, once defined by greed and solitude, is renewed through charity and human connection. Scrooge learns to “keep Christmas well,” embodying the joy and goodwill he once scorned, and proving that redemption and change are possible even for the hardest of hearts.\",44\n76,MARLEY,\"Jacob Marley is the deceased business partner of Ebenezer Scrooge, whose name still appears on the firm’s sign, “Scrooge and Marley.” Having died seven years before the events of *A Christmas Carol*, Marley remains a haunting presence in Scrooge’s life, both as a memory and as a supernatural figure. In life, Marley was much like Scrooge—greedy, cold, and consumed by business—but in death, he suffers the consequences of his selfishness and moral neglect. His ghost appears to Scrooge one Christmas Eve, bound in heavy chains forged from his own misdeeds, to warn his former partner of the fate that awaits him if he does not change his ways.  \n\nMarley’s visitation serves as the catalyst for Scrooge’s transformation. He tells Scrooge that he will be visited by three spirits who will offer him a chance at redemption. Through this warning, Marley acts as both a messenger and a symbol of conscience, representing the torment that comes from a life lived without compassion or generosity. His spectral appearance—often described with ghostly features such as a pigtail and a face that terrifies Scrooge—embodies the supernatural tone of the story and foreshadows the otherworldly encounters to come.  \n\nBeyond his role as a ghostly herald, Marley’s character carries deep thematic significance. He personifies guilt and the lingering consequences of one’s actions, showing that material success without moral integrity leads to eternal suffering. His continued association with Scrooge’s business name underscores how the past clings to the present, reminding Scrooge of the moral debts he has yet to pay. Marley’s warning is not only a plea for Scrooge’s salvation but also an expression of his own remorse, as he seeks to prevent his former partner from sharing his doomed fate.  \n\nIn summary, Jacob Marley is a pivotal figure in Charles Dickens’s *A Christmas Carol*—a ghostly messenger whose tragic existence and heartfelt warning initiate Scrooge’s journey toward redemption. His presence bridges the worlds of the living and the dead, symbolizing both the weight of guilt and the possibility of moral awakening. Through Marley’s haunting visitation, Dickens introduces the story’s central themes of repentance, compassion, and the transformative power of self-reflection.\",3\n81,CHAIN NOISE,\"The clanking noise of chains is heard after the bells ring, resembling the sound of a ghost dragging heavy chains through the house.

This disused bell, located in Scrooge’s room, is ordinarily silent and forgotten, connected by a wire to an upper chamber. Its sudden movement and ringing occur without any apparent cause, creating an atmosphere of mystery and dread. The moment the bell begins to swing and toll signifies the transition from the ordinary world to one governed by the supernatural.  \n\nThe tolling of the bell is not merely a random occurrence—it fulfills the warning previously given by Marley’s Ghost, who had foretold that Scrooge would be visited by other spirits. When the bell tolls one, it marks the precise moment of the first ghost’s arrival, confirming Marley’s prophecy and initiating the series of spectral visitations that will ultimately transform Scrooge’s life.  \n\nThe bell’s sound is described as eerie and unsettling, its movement inexplicable and its resonance deep enough to stir fear and astonishment in Scrooge. Though disused and seemingly insignificant, the bell becomes a powerful symbol of the boundary between the natural and supernatural realms. Its ringing serves as both a physical and psychological trigger—alerting Scrooge to the presence of forces beyond his comprehension and compelling him to confront the consequences of his life and choices.  \n\nIn essence, BELL represents the moment of awakening and transition. It is the herald of the ghostly encounters that follow, the instrument through which the supernatural world announces itself. Its tolling at one o’clock is not only a signal of time but also a signal of fate, marking the beginning of Scrooge’s journey toward redemption.  \n\nThus, BELL is both a literal and symbolic device within the story: a disused object brought to life by unseen powers, a messenger of the spiritual realm, and the first tangible sign that Scrooge’s world is about to change forever.\",3\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n645,EBENEZER SCROOGE,SPIRITS,The Spirits visited Scrooge during the night and caused his transformation from miserly to generous,183\n85,SCROOGE,MARLEY,\"Scrooge and Marley were business partners, and Scrooge is haunted by Marley’s memory and fears his ghostly return.\",47\n90,SCROOGE,CHAIN NOISE,\"Scrooge hears the clanking chain noise approaching his door, which he associates with ghostly activity, heightening his fear.\",47\n86,SCROOGE,WINE-MERCHANT'S CELLAR,\"Scrooge lives above the wine-merchant’s cellar, which amplifies sounds and contributes to his eerie experience.\",45\n91,SCROOGE,SITTING-ROOM,\"Scrooge inspects the sitting-room to ensure it is empty before locking himself in, showing his cautious nature.\",45\n92,SCROOGE,BEDROOM,\"Scrooge checks the bedroom for disturbances, reflecting his methodical and fearful behavior.\",45\n93,SCROOGE,LUMBER-ROOM,\"Scrooge examines the lumber-room, confirming that all is as usual, showing his attention to detail.\",45\n95,SCROOGE,HEARSE,\"Scrooge imagines a hearse ascending the staircase, reflecting his fear and the supernatural tone of the scene.\",45\n96,SCROOGE,DARKNESS,\"Scrooge embraces darkness, preferring it for its cheapness and comfort, symbolizing his miserly and isolated nature.\",45\n98,SCROOGE,STAIRCASE,\"Scrooge ascends the staircase, imagining a hearse before him, showing his eerie perception and fear.\",45\n99,SCROOGE,DOOR,\"Scrooge locks the door and later hears noises approaching it, symbolizing his isolation and the intrusion of the supernatural.\",45\n100,SCROOGE,CANDLE,\"Scrooge uses the candle to light his way through the dark house, representing his small resistance to fear and gloom.\",45\n248,SCROOGE,DICK,\"Scrooge and Dick were apprentices together under Fezziwig, sharing the experience of the Christmas celebration.\",45\n249,SCROOGE,YOUNG GIRL,The young girl was once engaged to Scrooge but ends their relationship due to his growing obsession with wealth and loss of affection.,45\n251,SCROOGE,FORMER SELF OF SCROOGE,Scrooge’s former self represents his youthful innocence and contrasts with his present hardened demeanor.,45\n671,SCROOGE,TOTAL-ABSTINENCE PRINCIPLE,\"Scrooge adopted the Total-Abstinence Principle after his experiences with the Spirits, symbolizing his moral renewal.\",45\n571,PHANTOM,THE ROOM OF DEATH,The Phantom reveals the dark room containing the dead man to Scrooge as part of its lesson about death and isolation.,7\n101,MARLEY,CHAIN NOISE,\"The chain noise symbolizes Marley’s ghost dragging chains, connecting the sound directly to Marley’s spectral presence.\",6\n112,BELL,CHAIN NOISE,\"The ringing of the bell precedes the chain noise, both forming part of the same supernatural sequence leading to Marley’s ghostly arrival.\",6\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
