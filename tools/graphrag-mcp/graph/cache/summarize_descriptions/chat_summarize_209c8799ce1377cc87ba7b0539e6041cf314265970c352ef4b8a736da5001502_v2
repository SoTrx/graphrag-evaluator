He is notably referenced in connection with Ebenezer Scrooge’s act of generosity in *A Christmas Carol*. After Scrooge’s transformation and embrace of the Christmas spirit, he seeks out the poulterer to purchase a large prize turkey. This turkey, which is described as exceptionally fine and impressive in size, becomes the centerpiece of Scrooge’s gesture of goodwill toward Bob Cratchit and his family. The poulterer thus plays a small but significant role in the story, serving as the means through which Scrooge expresses his newfound kindness and desire to share his wealth with others. As a tradesman, the poulterer represents the everyday working individuals of Victorian London, providing essential goods to the community.
