'All your other\nhopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of its sordid\nreproach. I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until\nthe master passion, Gain, engrosses you. Have I not?'\n\n'What then?' he retorted. 'Even if I have grown so much wiser, what\nthen? I am not changed towards you.'\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n'Am I?'\n\n'Our contract is an old one. It was made when we were both poor, and\ncontent to be so, until, in good season, we could improve our worldly\nfortune by our patient industry. You _are_ changed. When it was made you\nwere another man.'\n\n'I was a boy,' he said impatiently.\n\n'Your own feeling tells you that you were not what you are,' she\nreturned. 'I am. That which promised happiness when we were one in heart\nis fraught with misery now that we are two. How often and how keenly I\nhave thought of this I will not say. It is enough that I _have_ thought\nof it, and can release you.'\n\n'Have I ever sought release?'\n\n'In words. No. Never.'\n\n'In what, then?'\n\n'In a changed nature; in an altered spirit; in another atmosphere of\nlife; another Hope as its great end. In everything that made my love of\nany worth or value in your sight. If this had never been between us,'\nsaid the girl, looking mildly, but with steadiness, upon him; 'tell me,\nwould you seek me out and try to win me now? Ah, no!'\n\nHe seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition in spite of\nhimself. But he said, with a struggle, 'You think not.'\n\n'I would gladly think otherwise if I could,' she answered. 'Heaven\nknows! When _I_ have learned a Truth like this, I know how strong and\nirresistible it must be. But if you were free to-day, to-morrow,\nyesterday, can even I believe that you would choose a dowerless\ngirl--you who, in your very confidence with her, weigh everything by\nGain: or, choosing her, if for a moment you were false enough to your\none guiding principle to do so, do I not know that your repentance and\nregret would surely follow? I do; and I release you. With a full heart,\nfor the love of him you once were.'\n\n[Illustration: SHE LEFT HIM, AND THEY PARTED]\n\nHe was about to speak; but, with her head turned from him, she resumed:\n\n'You may--the memory of what is past half makes me hope you will--have\npain in this. A very, very brief time, and you will dismiss the\nrecollection of it gladly, as an unprofitable dream, from which it\nhappened well that you awoke. May you be happy in the life you have\nchosen!'\n\nShe left him, and they parted.\n\n'Spirit!' said Scrooge, 'show me no more! Conduct me home. Why do you\ndelight to torture me?'\n\n'One shadow more!' exclaimed the Ghost.\n\n'No more!' cried Scrooge. 'No more! I don't wish to see it. Show me no\nmore!'\n\nBut the relentless Ghost pinioned him in both his arms, and forced him\nto observe what happened next.\n\nThey were in another scene and place; a room, not very large or\nhandsome, but full of comfort. Near to the winter fire sat a beautiful\nyoung girl, so like that last that Scrooge believed it was the same,\nuntil he saw _her_, now a comely matron, sitting opposite her daughter.\nThe noise in this room was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more\nchildren there than Scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count;\nand, unlike the celebrated herd in the poem, they were not forty\nchildren conducting themselves like one, but every child was conducting\nitself like forty. The consequences were uproarious beyond belief; but\nno one seemed to care; on the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed\nheartily, and enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning to\nmingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands most\nruthlessly. What would I not have given to be one of them! Though I\nnever could have been so rude, no, no! I wouldn't for the wealth of all\nthe world have crushed that braided hair, and torn it down; and for the\nprecious little shoe, I wouldn't have plucked it off, God bless my soul!\nto save my life. As to measuring her waist in sport, as they did, bold\nyoung brood, I couldn't have done it; I should have expected my arm to\nhave grown round it for a punishment, and never come straight again. And\nyet I should have dearly liked, I own, to have touched her lips; to have\nquestioned her, that she might have opened them; to have looked upon the\nlashes of her downcast eyes, and never raised a blush; to have let loose\nwaves of hair, an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price: in\nshort, I should have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest\nlicense of a child, and yet to have been man enough to know its\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EBENEZER SCROOGE<|>PERSON<|>Ebenezer Scrooge is a man shown visions of his past by a supernatural spirit.
