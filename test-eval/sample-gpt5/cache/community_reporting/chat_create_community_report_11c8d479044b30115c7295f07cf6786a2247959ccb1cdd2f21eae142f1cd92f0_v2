FEZZIWIG,\"Mr. Fezziwig is Scrooge’s former employer, a jovial and kind-hearted merchant who treats his employees with generosity and warmth.\",2\n23,DICK WILKINS,\"Dick Wilkins is portrayed as Ebenezer Scrooge’s fellow apprentice during Scrooge’s youth, a time when both worked under the benevolent employer, Mr. Fezziwig. He is remembered fondly by Scrooge as a companion from his early days, representing a period of warmth, camaraderie, and joy before Scrooge’s later years of isolation and greed. Wilkins is depicted as participating in the lively Christmas festivities organized by Fezziwig, events that symbolize generosity and good cheer. His presence in these scenes highlights the contrast between Scrooge’s youthful happiness and his later coldness, serving as a reminder of the simple pleasures and human connections that once brought Scrooge joy. Dick Wilkins thus stands as a minor but meaningful figure in Scrooge’s past, embodying friendship, shared labor, and the spirit of celebration that characterized Fezziwig’s workshop.\",2\n44,CHRISTMAS EVE,\"Christmas Eve is the day and night before Christmas, serving as a pivotal moment in the story of Ebenezer Scrooge. It represents both the anticipation of Christmas Day and the emotional and moral contrasts that define Scrooge’s character. While most people celebrate Christmas Eve with warmth, generosity, and festivity, Scrooge initially views it with disdain, rejecting the joy and communal spirit that surround the holiday. This contrast highlights his isolation and cold-heartedness, setting the stage for his eventual transformation.\n\nWithin the narrative, Christmas Eve is the setting for several key events that reveal the themes of compassion, redemption, and the power of human connection. It is on this night that Scrooge’s cheerful nephew visits him, embodying the spirit of goodwill and family affection that Scrooge has long rejected. The nephew’s visit underscores the emotional divide between Scrooge and those who embrace the holiday’s meaning, emphasizing the warmth and generosity that Christmas Eve symbolizes.\n\nThe occasion also recalls Fezziwig’s festive party, a joyful celebration filled with dancing, food, and camaraderie among employees and friends. This memory serves as a stark contrast to Scrooge’s current life of solitude and greed, reminding him of a time when he valued happiness and human relationships over wealth. Fezziwig’s party exemplifies the communal joy and kindness that Christmas Eve inspires, reinforcing the idea that generosity and shared celebration bring true fulfillment.\n\nMost significantly, Christmas Eve marks the beginning of Scrooge’s supernatural and moral journey. On this night, he is visited by the ghost of Jacob Marley, his former business partner, whose appearance warns Scrooge of the consequences of his selfishness and greed. Marley’s visit initiates a series of encounters with other spirits that guide Scrooge toward self-reflection and redemption. Thus, Christmas Eve becomes not only a time of external festivity but also a moment of profound internal awakening.\n\nIn essence, Christmas Eve in the story symbolizes both the joy of human connection and the potential for personal transformation. It contrasts the warmth and generosity of the season with Scrooge’s initial coldness, while also serving as the catalyst for his change. Through the visits, memories, and supernatural revelations that occur on this night, Christmas Eve emerges as a powerful representation of renewal, compassion, and the enduring spirit of Christmas.\",5\n19,MRS.
