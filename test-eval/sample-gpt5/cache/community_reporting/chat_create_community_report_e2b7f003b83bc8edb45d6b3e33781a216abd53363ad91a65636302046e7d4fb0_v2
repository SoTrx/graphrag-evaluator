It represents human perseverance and vigilance in the face of natural adversity. The lighthouse’s placement on the reef underscores its role as a beacon of safety amid danger, serving both practical and symbolic functions.

It serves as the central hub of human life within the community, contrasting the isolation of the lighthouse. The ship’s crew—including the helmsman, look-out, and officers—embodies cooperation and shared purpose.
