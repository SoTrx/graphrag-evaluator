The relationships among these entities reveal a network of opportunistic trade driven by poverty and moral decay.

The shop’s role is not directly described in the entity list but is inferred through multiple relationships connecting Old Joe to the charwoman and other traders. This setting symbolizes the commodification of death and the erosion of moral boundaries among the impoverished. The transactions occurring here are not merely economic but ethical exchanges that reveal the characters’ desensitization to mortality and loss. The shop thus becomes a metaphorical marketplace for human greed and survival instincts, illustrating how necessity can distort moral judgment.

She brings household goods such as sheets and towels to Old Joe, viewing the act as an opportunity rather than a transgression. Her behavior underscores the social conditions that drive individuals to exploit death for material gain. In the context of the community, Mrs. Dilber’s actions exemplify the normalization of theft and the erosion of empathy among the lower classes struggling for subsistence.

Their collaboration with Mrs. Dilber and the charwoman forms a small but cohesive network of opportunists who profit from death. The laundress’s bundle of goods and the undertaker’s faded black clothing symbolize their respective roles in the cycle of death and exploitation.

The charwoman’s actions reveal a callousness toward death and a willingness to profit from another’s misfortune.

His death triggers the actions of the charwoman, Mrs. Dilber, the laundress, and the undertaker’s man, each of whom exploits his possessions. The description of the dead man as greedy and unloved in life mirrors the greed of those who scavenge his belongings, creating a moral symmetry between the deceased and his exploiters. This dynamic underscores the theme of moral reciprocity—those who live by greed are ultimately consumed by it, even in death.
