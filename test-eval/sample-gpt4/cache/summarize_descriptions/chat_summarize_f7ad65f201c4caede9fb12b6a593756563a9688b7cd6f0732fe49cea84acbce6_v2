His spectral presence serves as a grim reminder of mortality and the consequences of one's life choices. Marley is condemned to wander the earth, burdened by the chains forged by his own selfish and greedy actions during his lifetime. He visits Scrooge to warn him about the dire fate that awaits if he continues on his current path. Additionally, Marley foretells the coming of three Spirits who will guide Scrooge toward redemption, urging him to change his ways before it is too late.
