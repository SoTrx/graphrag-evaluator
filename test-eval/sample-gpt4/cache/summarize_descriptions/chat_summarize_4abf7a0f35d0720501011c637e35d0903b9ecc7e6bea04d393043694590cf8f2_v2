Throughout the narrative, Scrooge is confronted by the ghost of his former business partner, Jacob Marley, who warns him of the consequences of his selfish life. This supernatural visitation leads Scrooge to experience confusion about the passage of time as he is shown visions of his past, present, and future. Among these visions is a haunting glimpse of his own future death, depicted in a graveyard, which prompts him to reflect deeply on his life and actions.
