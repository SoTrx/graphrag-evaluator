Fred embodies warmth, cheer, and the joyful spirit of the holiday, consistently embracing Christmas with laughter and goodwill. Each year, particularly on Christmas Eve, Fred visits Scrooge with good temper and a sincere wish for a merry Christmas, hoping to encourage his uncle to partake in the festive celebrations. Despite Fred's persistent efforts and positive approach, Scrooge remains cynical, miserly, and harsh, dismissing the holiday spirit and maintaining a cold demeanor.
