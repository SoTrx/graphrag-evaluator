The Mansion is directly connected to three subsidiary entities on its grounds: the Stables, Coach-Houses, and Sheds.

This description highlights the Mansion's symbolic role as a representation of decline and neglect, likely tied to a narrative or historical context. Its prominence is underscored by its higher degree of connectivity compared to other entities, indicating its centrality within the community.

The sheds' condition suggests that the estate's outbuildings have been left to deteriorate, contributing to the impression of a forgotten or abandoned property.
