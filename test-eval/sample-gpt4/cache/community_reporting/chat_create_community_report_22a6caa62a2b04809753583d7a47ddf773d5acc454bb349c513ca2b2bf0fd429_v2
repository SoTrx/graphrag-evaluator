His role is pivotal in defining the working environment and conditions experienced by the clerk. The relationship between Scrooge and the clerk is characterized by a strict and frugal management style, as evidenced by Scrooge's control over resources such as coal for heating, which he keeps in his own room, limiting the clerk's ability to stay warm.
