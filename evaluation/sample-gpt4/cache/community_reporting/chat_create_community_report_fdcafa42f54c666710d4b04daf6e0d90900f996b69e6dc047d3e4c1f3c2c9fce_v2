Marley’s spectral presence serves as a grim reminder of mortality and the consequences of one’s life choices, emphasizing themes of regret and responsibility. His role is to warn Ebenezer Scrooge of the dire fate that awaits if he continues on his current path, and to foretell the coming of three Spirits who will guide Scrooge toward redemption.
