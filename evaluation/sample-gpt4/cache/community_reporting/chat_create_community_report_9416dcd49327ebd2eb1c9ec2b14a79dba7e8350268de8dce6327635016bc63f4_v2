Beyond legitimate scrap dealing, he functions as a fence and appraiser for stolen goods, specifically items taken from the dead. His calm and retired demeanor belies his involvement in the underworld, where he evaluates and purchases plundered items, indicating a dual role that straddles both legal and illegal activities.
