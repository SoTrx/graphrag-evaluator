He is a tight-fisted, covetous businessman and partner in the counting-house firm \"\"Scrooge and Marley,\"\" known for his harsh demeanor, grating voice, and dismissive attitude toward the holiday, famously calling it \"\"Humbug.\"\" Scrooge lives alone in gloomy chambers in the City of London, characterized by his ill-will, stinginess, and skepticism about supernatural occurrences. He is indifferent to the suffering of the poor, refusing to donate to charity, and his attitude casts a dark shadow on those around him, including his employee Bob Cratchit and his family.\n\nScrooge’s nephew Fred and niece discuss his miserly behavior and coldness, highlighting his reluctance to join in Christmas festivities or show familial warmth. Despite his stern and unfeeling nature, Scrooge is shown to have a complex past, including memories of happier times such as Fezziwig’s Christmas ball, which evoke emotional reflection and contrast with his later greed and avarice.\n\nThe story’s pivotal moment occurs when Scrooge is visited by the ghost of his former business partner Marley, who warns him of the consequences of his selfish life and foretells visits from three spirits: the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future. These supernatural visitations lead Scrooge on a profound journey of self-reflection. He is shown scenes from his own past, including his lonely childhood and lost opportunities for happiness, the present hardships faced by the Cratchit family—especially the frail Tiny Tim—and a grim vision of his own lonely death if he does not change his ways.\n\nThrough these visions, Scrooge confronts the impact of his actions and attitudes, leading to a dramatic transformation. He becomes generous and kind-hearted, embracing the spirit of Christmas. He raises Bob Cratchit’s salary, assists the Cratchit family, and becomes a warm and cheerful figure, known for his generosity and goodwill. Scrooge purchases a large prize turkey to send to the Cratchits and reconciles with his nephew Fred, embodying the values of kindness, charity, and community.\n\nUltimately, Ebenezer Scrooge’s story is one of redemption and change, moving from a life marked by miserliness, bitterness, and isolation to one characterized by generosity, warmth, and joyful participation in the Christmas spirit.

This attitude highlights his miserly and morose nature. In contrast, other characters, such as Scrooge’s nephew, embrace Christmas as a season of kindness, charity, and goodwill toward others.
