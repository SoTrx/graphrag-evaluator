It symbolizes the weight of Marley’s greed and materialism during his lifetime.\",2\n66,MARLEY'S GHOST,\"Marley’s Ghost refers to the supernatural visitation of Jacob Marley’s spirit to Ebenezer Scrooge, a pivotal event in Charles Dickens’s *A Christmas Carol*. The encounter begins when Scrooge notices the eerie transformation of his door knocker into the face of his deceased business partner, Jacob Marley—a chilling omen that foreshadows the ghostly events to come. Later that night, Marley’s spirit fully manifests in Scrooge’s room, appearing bound in heavy chains that symbolize the greed and selfishness he carried through life. The ghost’s presence is accompanied by a cold, oppressive atmosphere and unmistakable physical signs of the supernatural, such as the rattling of chains and spectral movements that confirm its reality to the skeptical Scrooge.  \n\nDuring this visitation, Marley speaks directly to Scrooge, warning him of the dire consequences of continuing his miserly and unfeeling ways. He explains that his own suffering in the afterlife is the result of his earthly obsession with business and neglect of compassion and humanity. Marley’s message is not merely one of despair but of hope for Scrooge’s redemption. He foretells the arrival of three spirits—the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Yet to Come—who will each guide Scrooge through visions designed to awaken his empathy and transform his outlook on life.  \n\nMarley’s Ghost thus serves as both a harbinger and a moral catalyst within the narrative. His appearance marks the transition from the mundane world of Scrooge’s cold materialism to the realm of spiritual reckoning and emotional renewal. The encounter is deeply symbolic, illustrating Dickens’s themes of repentance, moral responsibility, and the possibility of change. Through Marley’s warning, Scrooge is confronted with the consequences of his choices and offered a chance to alter his fate before it is too late.  \n\nIn essence, Marley’s Ghost embodies the haunting power of conscience and the enduring hope for redemption.
