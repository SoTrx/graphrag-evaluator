It symbolizes the modest conditions under which the apprentices live, sleeping behind the business premises rather than in separate housing. This dual-purpose space reflects the economic and social structure of the time, where apprentices were integrated into the business environment both professionally and personally.

Positioned above the apprentices’ beds, it represents the intersection of commerce and domestic life. The apprentices’ sleeping arrangements beneath the counter highlight their subordinate position within the business hierarchy and the close proximity between their labor and rest.

The counter is located within the back-shop, forming part of the apprentices’ sleeping area.

This setting reflects the apprentices’ low social status and the expectation of hard work and modest living as part of their training.

Apprentices living behind the shop indicate a cost-efficient system that minimizes housing expenses while ensuring constant availability of labor.
