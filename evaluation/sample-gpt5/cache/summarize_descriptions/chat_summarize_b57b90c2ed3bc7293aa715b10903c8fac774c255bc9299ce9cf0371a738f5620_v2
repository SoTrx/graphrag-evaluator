He serves as both a messenger and a symbol within his story, bringing Caroline the news of their creditor’s death—a moment that marks a turning point in their lives. This event, though grim in nature, carries with it a sense of cautious optimism, as it signifies the possible end of the oppressive debt that has weighed heavily on them.  \n\nIn his demeanor and actions, Caroline’s husband embodies the quiet endurance of those who have lived under the constant pressure of financial obligation. His reaction to the news is not one of callous joy but of profound relief, shared with his wife, as they both begin to imagine a future free from the fear and anxiety that have long defined their existence. The death of the creditor represents liberation from a system that has kept them in perpetual distress, and his response captures the complex emotions of gratitude, sorrow, and hope that accompany such a moment.  \n\nThrough his character, Caroline’s husband stands as a representative of the many individuals burdened by debt and social inequality.
