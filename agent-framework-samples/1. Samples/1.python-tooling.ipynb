    "# 🛠️ Agent Tools with Microsoft Agent Framework (Python)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to enhance agents with specialized tools using Azure AI Foundry. You'll see how to add capabilities like file search, code execution, web search, vision processing, and MCP tool integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tools Covered:**\n",
    "- 📄 **File Search (RAG)**: Query uploaded documents with vector search\n",
    "- 💻 **Code Interpreter**: Execute Python code to solve problems\n",
    "- 🌐 **Web Search (Bing)**: Real-time web information retrieval\n",
    "- 👁️ **Vision**: Process and analyze images\n",
    "- 🔌 **MCP Tools**: Connect to external services via Model Context Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ Setup Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Docker & Dev Container**\n",
    "- Install Docker on your machine\n",
    "- Open this project in the dev container (VS Code will prompt you)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Workspace Configuration**\n",
    "- Open the workspace: `File > Open Workspace from File` → select `workspace.code-workspace`\n",
    "- This sets up the correct Python environment for each project folder\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Environment Variables**\n",
    "1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the `agent-framework-samples` folder:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cp .env.example .env\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. Fill in your credentials:\n",
    "   ```env\n",
    "   # Azure AI Foundry (Required for all examples)\n",
    "   AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT=your_project_endpoint\n",
    "   AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=your_model_deployment\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Bing Search (Required for Web Search example)\n",
    "   BING_CONNECTION_ID=your_bing_connection_id\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Azure AI Foundry Setup**\n",
    "- Create an Azure AI Foundry project\n",
    "- Deploy a model (e.g., gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini)\n",
    "- For Bing Search: Create a Bing Search connection in your project\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 What You'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you'll find code samples demonstrating:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **RAG with File Search**: Upload documents and query them with semantic search\n",
    "2. **Code Execution**: Let agents write and run Python code (Fibonacci example)\n",
    "3. **Web Research**: Search the web and get real-time information\n",
    "4. **Vision Processing**: Analyze images and extract information (furniture example)\n",
    "5. **MCP Integration**: Two ways to connect external tools via MCP\n",
    "\n",
    "Each example shows the complete flow: creating the agent, configuring tools, and running queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore agent capabilities! 🌟"

      "- Planning & Orchestration: Built-in mechanisms for the AI to plan and execute multi-step processes or workflows on the fly.\n",

      "- Rapid prototyping of AI-powered features in enterprise and consumer apps.\n",
      "- Building advanced copilots and agents that interact with users and systems.\n",
      "- Integrating multiple LLMs or AI providers (like Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, Amazon Bedrock, Google Gemini) in your solutions.\n",

      "- **Central Orchestrator:** It serves as the \"kernel,\" a central component that manages all the services (like LLMs) and plugins (custom code and logic) necessary to build your AI application.\n",
      "- **Flexible Integration:** You can add different AI services, build workflows that combine AI with your own code, and add enterprise features like logging.\n",
      "- **Build Agents & Copilots:** Enables creation of sophisticated AI agents, from simple chatbots to complex copilots and autonomous agents, even for users without deep AI expertise.\n",
      "- **Prompt Engineering:** Supports advanced prompt development, including prompt templating, chaining, and memory.\n",
      "- **Enterprise Ready:** Suited for creating apps with observability, security, and extensibility in mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example Use Cases\n",
      "- Agents that can autonomously execute processes\n",
      "- Intelligent chatbots and copilots to assist users\n",
      "- Automations that combine AI-driven content with calls to your own APIs or business logic\n",
      "\n",
      "### How does it work?\n",
      "- The “kernel” is like a special dependency injection container.\n",
      "- You configure it by adding the AI services and plugins.\n",
      "- When you invoke a prompt or agent, the kernel chooses the best service, sends the request, processes the response, and provides extensibility so you can inject custom logic (e.g., logging, monitoring, custom events).\n",
