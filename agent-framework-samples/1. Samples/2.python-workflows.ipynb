    "# 🔄 Agent Workflows with Microsoft Agent Framework (Python)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows you how to create multi-agent workflows where multiple AI agents work together in sequence. You'll build a simple travel recommendation workflow with two agents: a front desk agent and a reviewer agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What's Inside:**\n",
    "- 🏗️ **Workflow Builder**: Chain multiple agents together\n",
    "- 📊 **Workflow Visualization**: See your workflow as a diagram\n",
    "- 🔄 **Event-Driven Execution**: Process workflow results step by step\n",
    "- 🤝 **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Agents reviewing each other's work\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ Setup Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Docker & Dev Container**\n",
    "- Install Docker on your machine\n",
    "- Open this project in the dev container (VS Code will prompt you)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Workspace Configuration**\n",
    "- Open the workspace: `File > Open Workspace from File` → select `workspace.code-workspace`\n",
    "- This sets up the correct Python environment for each project folder\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Environment Variables**\n",
    "1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the `agent-framework-samples` folder:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cp .env.example .env\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. Fill in your Azure credentials:\n",
    "   ```env\n",
    "   # Azure OpenAI (Required for this example)\n",
    "   AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your_endpoint\n",
    "   AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=your_deployment\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **System Dependencies**\n",
    "The notebook will install graphviz automatically for workflow visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 What You'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple workflow with two agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "User Request → Front Desk Agent → Reviewer Agent → Final Response\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Front Desk Agent**: Provides travel recommendations\n",
    "2. **Reviewer Agent**: Reviews and validates the recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll see:\n",
    "- How to define agent instructions\n",
    "- How to connect agents in a workflow\n",
    "- How to visualize the workflow structure\n",
    "- How to run the workflow and process results\n",
