    "# 🛠️ Agent Tools with Microsoft Agent Framework (Python)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to enhance agents with specialized tools using Azure AI Foundry. You'll see how to add capabilities like file search, code execution, web search, vision processing, and MCP tool integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tools Covered:**\n",
    "- 📄 **File Search (RAG)**: Query uploaded documents with vector search\n",
    "- 💻 **Code Interpreter**: Execute Python code to solve problems\n",
    "- 🌐 **Web Search (Bing)**: Real-time web information retrieval\n",
    "- 👁️ **Vision**: Process and analyze images\n",
    "- 🔌 **MCP Tools**: Connect to external services via Model Context Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ Setup Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Docker & Dev Container**\n",
    "- Install Docker on your machine\n",
    "- Open this project in the dev container (VS Code will prompt you)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Workspace Configuration**\n",
    "- Open the workspace: `File > Open Workspace from File` → select `workspace.code-workspace`\n",
    "- This sets up the correct Python environment for each project folder\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Environment Variables**\n",
    "1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the `agent-framework-samples` folder:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cp .env.example .env\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. Fill in your credentials:\n",
    "   ```env\n",
    "   # Azure AI Foundry (Required for all examples)\n",
    "   AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT=your_project_endpoint\n",
    "   AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=your_model_deployment\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Bing Search (Required for Web Search example)\n",
    "   BING_CONNECTION_ID=your_bing_connection_id\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Azure AI Foundry Setup**\n",
    "- Create an Azure AI Foundry project\n",
    "- Deploy a model (e.g., gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini)\n",
    "- For Bing Search: Create a Bing Search connection in your project\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 What You'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you'll find code samples demonstrating:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **RAG with File Search**: Upload documents and query them with semantic search\n",
    "2. **Code Execution**: Let agents write and run Python code (Fibonacci example)\n",
    "3. **Web Research**: Search the web and get real-time information\n",
    "4. **Vision Processing**: Analyze images and extract information (furniture example)\n",
    "5. **MCP Integration**: Two ways to connect external tools via MCP\n",
    "\n",
    "Each example shows the complete flow: creating the agent, configuring tools, and running queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore agent capabilities! 🌟"
