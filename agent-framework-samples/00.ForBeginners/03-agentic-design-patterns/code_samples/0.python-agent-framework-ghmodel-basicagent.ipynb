    "# 🎨 Agentic Design Patterns with GitHub Models (Python)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates essential design patterns for building intelligent agents using the Microsoft Agent Framework with GitHub Models integration. You'll learn proven patterns and architectural approaches that make agents more robust, maintainable, and effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Design Patterns Covered:**\n",
    "- 🏗️ **Agent Factory Pattern**: Standardized agent creation and configuration\n",
    "- 🔧 **Tool Registry Pattern**: Organized approach to managing agent capabilities\n",
    "- 🧵 **Conversation Management**: Effective patterns for multi-turn interactions\n",
    "- 🔄 **Response Processing**: Best practices for handling agent outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Key Architectural Concepts\n",
    "\n",
